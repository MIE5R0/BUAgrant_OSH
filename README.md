# BUA call open science and research quality

We are preparing a grant application for this call. We are planning to build a prototype architecture for the peer review and publication of hardware. It aims at (1) defining workflows and documentation needs for the production of FAIR hardware and (2) build a prototype to make these FAIR hardware open and citable. 
> FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable

We are first defining our objectives and work packages in [this early document](discussion_doc.md). We may also work on the application here on a second phase.
