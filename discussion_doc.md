 # BUA grant discussion
 
 # Problems to solve
 
 - researchers do not know how to document their hardware.
 - researchers have no way to get recognition on their work as hardware engineers.
 - researchers do not know where to find open hardware they could use.
 
 # Work packages
 
 ## WP1: Towards FAIR hardware 
 
 Building on the [review system that is prototyped in the open next project](https://en.oho.wiki/wiki/Home), we will document existing hardware created in the academic labs (see http://www.neuro-airtrack.com/ for an example).
 
We will provide a guide and template structures to help researchers to prepare their hardware and its documentation for its peer review.
 
 ## WP2: Peer review infrastructure
 
 We will extend the prototype mentioned above to be compatible with a publication workflow happening on a git-based platform. We will consider the possiblity to use 
 (1) the [JOSS infrastructure](joss.theoj.org/), where the review happens on the GitHub platform,
 (2) a Gitlab infrastructure,
 (3) a GIN-like infrastructure (https://gin.g-node.org/).
 
 The three tools use a similar wiki system, that would be compatible with the existing prototype.
 The development or application of a bot similar to the weadon bot used at JOSS or the Tonic bot used with GIN and gitlab will be created.
 
 ## WP3: Recognition
 
 While the peer review can be used without or prior to the publication of the hardware,
 we will provide a way for researchers to publish their work as non-traditional research outputs.
 We will consider both the production of a doi for a snapshot of the repository (via zenodo, Dspace or GIN), 
 or the production of a paper similar to what JOSS is doing, or via a OJS system, as is developed in the [modern publishing project in Hambourg](https://oa-pub.hos.tuhh.de/en/)
The system will be compatible with the current publishing industry, in order to facilitate hardware citation.
On the other hand, we will implement a contributor role taxonomy ([CREDIT or CRO](http://credit.niso.org/)), to report the role of each author in a computer readable form.
